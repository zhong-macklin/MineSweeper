In this directory should be two items:

* Architecture.md -- a markdown-formatted file that explains how the
  application is designed.  Each class is to be described (role in the 
  application, what state is maintained, etc.).  You can edit this file
  directly in GitHub.com and see the rendered file there.

* A PDF showing the classes diagram for the application.  This PDF should be 
  produced by exporting a diagram created in draw.io or dia.  Remember to 
  git add-commit-push this PDF file as it's not already part of your 
  starter repo.
